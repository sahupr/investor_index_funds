INDIREX - CREATE YOUR OWN INDEX FUNDS

This project aims to give you the freedom to create your own index funds by choosing your tickers, backtesting with upto 10 years of past data and rebalancing your funds dynamically within a specified range.

A flask application in which you can enter your tickers and rebalancing period will let you do the backtesting. If you are interested, you can go ahead and place your trade! A frontend application prototype is available inside the package which gets the idea across. A set of backtesting graphs can also be found inside the static/images folder of the project.
